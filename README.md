# Photo Gallery Example

A really quick exampled created throughout weeks 4-6, continued in week 8 to demonstrate `position` and will be used going forward.

## Week 8 Tasks

1. Style the `.nav-bar` and `.main-menu` so that it looks good on a _small-viewport-width_ device
    * First, style the bar so that the items are stacked top to bottom
    * Next, set the `.nav-bar` to `position: fixed;` so that it stays over-top of all content all of the time.
    * Ensure that no content is inaccessable.
2. Next step, blah blah.
